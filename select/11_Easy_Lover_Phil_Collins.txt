Easy lover
She'll get a hold on you, believe it
Like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees

She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see

(She's the kind of girl you dream of)
(Dream of keeping hold of)
(You'd better forget it)
(You'll never get it)

(She will play around and leave you)
(Leave you and deceive you)
(You better forget it)
(Or you'll regret it)

No you'll never change her
So leave her, leave her
Get out quick 'cause seein' is believin'
It's the only way you'll ever know, oh-oh-oh (you'll ever know oh-oh-oh)

She's an easy lover (She's an easy lover)
She'll get a hold on you, believe it (She'll get a hold on you, believe it)
Like no other (Like no other)
Before you know it, you'll be on your knees (Before you know it, you'll be on your knees)

She's an easy lover (She's an easy lover)
She'll take your heart, but you won't feel it (She'll take your heart, but you won't feel it)
She's like no other (She's like no other)
And I'm just trying to make you see (And I'm just trying to make you see)

(You're the one that wants to hold her)
(Hold her and control her)
(You'd better forget it)
(You'll never get it)

(For she'll say that there's no other)
('Til she finds another)
(You'd better forget it)
(Or you'll regret it)

And don't try to change her
Just leave her, leave her
You're not the only one, 'cause seeing is believing
It's the only way you'll ever know, oh-oh-oh (you'll ever know oh-oh-oh)
(Ahh-ah, ahh-ah)

Now don't try to change her
